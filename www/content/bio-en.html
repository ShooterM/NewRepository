		Good time of day, dear visitor! This web page was
		developed to display my work in php, it is immediately
		noticeable on the main menu and title above) But first, I want to
		briefly tell you about myself. My name is Michael Boichuk. I was born on
		the winter of 1992 in the glorious city of Chernivtsi. Until four or
		five years old, living on the streets Khortitskiy later moved with his
		parents to n, where I live and up to date. My education began in
		secondary school number 28, which was six minutes away from my house,
		I liked to study because parents cared about this and did not control
		me, giving me the opportunity to study literally "for yourself". In
		high school, our class began with in-depth study of geography,
		because at first I wanted to go to heofaku not yet contemplated
		prospects and enrolled in college CNU after ninth grade. From there
		began my real introduction to "adult world" programming and in general
		began to reflect more on the future. Also involved and engaged in
		several sports: mostly extreme and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
		After college he entered the Department of Applied Mathematics,
		Chernivtsi National University, handicrafts, in the third year, on
		the same specialty "Applied Mathematics" (the same name that is also
		in college at such a studied), where I continue to learn. Also I have
		a cat Batik - this is my pet, the required haste koshacha muzzle
		slept all day, and at night I sleep does not. So here, if that, then
		I do Elbe in the morning, and because for obvious reasons they can not
		be very well maintained ), so pposhu not quarrel, I\'m not guilty - I
		was framed. But hopefully this will not happen. All right, enough
		about me, I wish you a nice time and time spending and remember the
		adage about " curious barbarians" or "nose and question" ). Good Luck.
